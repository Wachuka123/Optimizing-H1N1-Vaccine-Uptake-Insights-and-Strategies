# H1N1 VACCINE UPTAKE ANALYSIS

As the world struggles to vaccinate the global population against COVID-19, understanding how people's backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors are related to their personal vaccination patterns can provide invaluable guidance for future public health efforts. By analyzing these factors, public health officials can better design strategies that encourage vaccination and improve overall public health outcomes.



## Business understanding
In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the drivers behind vaccine uptake is crucial. By leveraging historical data from the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, public health officials can gain insights into how various factors such as personal backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors influence vaccination decisions. These insights can then be applied to enhance current and future vaccination efforts for COVID-19 and other diseases.


## Objectives
1. Identify Key Predictors: Determine which factors (e.g., age, gender, education level, health behaviors, trust in healthcare) are most strongly associated with receiving the H1N1 vaccine.
2. Develop a Predictive Model: Create a binary classification model to predict whether an individual received the H1N1 vaccine based on their survey responses.
3. Inform Public Health Strategies: Use the modelâ€™s insights to guide public health campaigns, improving vaccine uptake by addressing barriers and leveraging motivators identified through the data. By focusing on predicting the uptake of the H1N1 vaccine, this project aims to provide actionable recommendations that can be applied to enhance vaccination rates and protect public health in current and future pandemics.

## Modelling
 The baseline model demonstrated an accuracy of 0.85, while the SMOTE-enhanced logistic regression adjusted for class imbalance, showing slightly lower accuracy but better recall for the minority class.

The hyperparameter-tuned random forest and ensemble methods provided the best balance between precision and recall, achieving the highest overall performance metrics, which were further supported by gradient boosting techniques that also achieved an accuracy of 0.86.


## Results
Best Overall Model: Both the Gradient Boosting model and the Ensemble methods model perform the best overall, with the highest accuracy of 0.86 and balanced performance metrics.

People with higher education and knowledge levels correlate with higher vaccination rates, hence these factors influence the decision to get vaccinated for the seasonal flu as well.

On the other hand  behavioral features ('behavioral_antiviral_meds ', 'behavioral_face_mask', 'behavioral_wash_hands' among others) show very weak correlations with the h1n1_vaccine, suggesting they have little influence on driving vaccination behavior.
## Limitations
1. Data Quality and Missing Values: The presence of missing values and potential inaccuracies in the dataset can affect the reliability of the models. Ensuring high-quality, complete data is crucial for accurate predictions.
2. Feature Selection and Engineering: The choice of features and their transformations play a critical role in model performance. Inadequate feature engineering or overlooking important predictors can lead to suboptimal models.
3. Generalizability: Models trained on this specific H1N1 dataset might not generalize well to other contexts or future pandemics without additional tuning and validation.

## Recommendations
1. Address Class Imbalance: Use Advanced Techniques: Apply advanced methods like SMOTE, ADASYN, or ensemble techniques specifically designed for imbalanced datasets to ensure models perform well across both majority and minority classes.
2. Enhance Feature Engineering: Develop features that capture interactions between existing variables, such as the interaction between concern about H1N1 and knowledge about the virus.
3.Comprehensive Data Collection: Ensure future surveys or data collection efforts capture all relevant features comprehensively, particularly those that might influence vaccine uptake.

## Conclusion
* Enhancing vaccination rates and protecting public health require a multifaceted approach that combines effective communication, improved accessibility, targeted policies, and continuous monitoring.
* By implementing these recommendations, public health authorities can better prepare for and respond to current and future pandemics, ensuring higher vaccine uptake and greater protection for the population.
